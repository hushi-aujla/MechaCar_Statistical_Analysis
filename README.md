# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview of project
In this project using R we will
Markup: *Perform linear regression analysis to indetify the variables that predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
        * Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch of the suspension cols from the manufacturing lots
        * Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
        * design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

*The vehichle length and ground clearance both represent non-random amounts of variance against mpg values.
* the slope of the linear model can not be considered to be zero
* this model deos predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototype fairly accurately as the r-squared value indicates that the model is 71% accurate

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* The overall variance in the total summary data does not exceed the 100 psi limit but the variance level in lot 3 is above the 100 psi threshold.
